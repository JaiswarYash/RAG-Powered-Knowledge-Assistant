### DocumentProcessor

`DocumentProcessor` handles document ingestion and preprocessing.  
It reads PDF files and splits extracted text into configurable chunks using LangChain's `CharacterTextSplitter` to support embedding and retrieval workflows.

### Document Loader

This module loads and preprocesses documents from multiple formats:
- `.doc/docx` files are read as plain `docx2text`
- `.pdf` files are parsed using `PyPDF2`
